./dish_ids/README

All models in the Nutrition5k paper were only trained on data from Cafe 1.
- Cafe 1 data consists of all dish ids from dish_1556572657 to dish_1568666357
- Cafe 2 data consists of all dish ids from dish_1571931457 to dish_1576259776

The ../splits/ directory lists the splits used in our experiments. Note that
because depth information is only available for a subset of the dishes, the
depth_*_split.txt files are subsets of the rgb_*_splits.txt files.
